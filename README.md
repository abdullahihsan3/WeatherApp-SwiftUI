## Architecture

The app is built using the clean architecture pattern. Here's a brief overview of the different layers:

- Model: The data layer that represents the app's data and business logic.
- View: The UI layer that displays the data to the user and handles user input.
- Managers: Managers are used to access other managers or views. 


## Usage

1. Clone the repository locally:

2. Update the OpenWeatherMap API key located in the constants file in the project

3. Run your project and fetch the current weather data directly from the API.
